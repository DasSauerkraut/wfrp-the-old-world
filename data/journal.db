At that time, Ubersreik was little more than a ruin recently retaken by the State Army of Reikland. The newly crowned emperor, Magnus the Pious, was keen to rebuild what was lost, so commissioned his Dwarf allies to construct a new crossing over the Teufel; the previous bridge had collapsed during the battles to retake the town from stubborn Greenskins.</p>\n<p>Two centuries later, and the bridge still dominates Ubersreik. It is supported by a number of great, stone pillars sunk deep into the riverbed, to a height making it visible from much of the town. The pillars, tightly grouped near the riverbank, open out in the centre, offering two broad channels through which even tall masted river barges can safely pass. The bridge is inscribed with ancient Dwarf runes, ensuring strength and stability.</p>\n<p>Local laws prohibit building atop the bridge, meaning those traversing it are greeted with some fine views of both sides of the town and the river surging beneath. Unseen from this vantage, the homeless gather under the bridge when the river isn&rsquo;t swollen. There they seek to avoid the worst the weather has to offer. Historically the Jungfreuds periodically swept this largely Human detritus away, though the poor and destitute would always return in foul weather.</p>\n<p>Of late, the Altdorfers have shown no signs of clearing these unfortunates away. As a result, a small shanty town, known locally as Dunkelfeucht, has sprung up under the bridge&rsquo;s shadow. The Jungfreud supporters in Ubersreik turn their noses up at this development, citing it as yet another failing of the interlopers from the north.</p>\n<p>Indeed, even the most loyal supporter of the Emperor has to admit that any right-thinking citizen of Ubersreik should be concerned at the unchecked expansion of the Dunkelfeucht. It has not only garnered a particularly foul reputation for attracting the very worst folk Ubersreik has to offer, it is also martialling itself, meaning any future attempt to clear the folk from under the bridge will be met with significant resistance.</p>\n<p>Because of this, only the desperate now venture there. Gangs and footpads prowl, and few mornings pass without blood being shed or a fresh body found adrift on the river&rsquo;s current. Unsurprisingly, the Altdorf-led Watch now avoids the place completely, knowing there is little to be gained by antagonising the new powers-thatbe below the bridge. This freedom from law-enforcement has allowed several makeshift jetties to be built by smuggling gangs. Finding their activities unchallenged, many of these gangs have become bold, often offloading large barges in broad daylight without fear of reprise. Of course, some onlookers mutter that such brazen criminality would never have been allowed when the Jungfreuds ruled, but such talk is divisive, and likely to start arguments, brawls, and even riots.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>Recent rumours suggest the gangs of the Dunkelfeucht are being bound together by a new leader known only as &lsquo;@Actor[The Baron]&rsquo;. Though a new arrival to Ubersreik, this criminal mastermind is already known for his ambition and utter ruthlessness. Few outside Dunkelfeucht have ever clapped eyes on him, though most Ubersreikers have heard of him and fear him. If rumours are to be believed, he already has scores of thieves, thugs, and smugglers under his control, and he intends to spread from the docklands quickly, quashing any attempts to thwart the rise of his newly forged criminal empire.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&bull; the party have been hired by klaus osfer to locate his brother Ulli, who is somewhere in dunkelfeucht. Ulli was kicked out of home by his father, who has now passed away, and klaus wants him to come back. to get to him, the party will need to negotiate with the baron, and her thugs, who seem more interested in selling the party&rsquo;s trappings &mdash; and body parts.</p>\n<p>&bull; barrels of explosives have been reported stolen from the miners&rsquo; Guild, and the trail seems to lead to dunkelfeucht. if the party investigate, they will discover the explosives are being stockpiled against some of the pillars of the bridge, with a view to destroying it. This plan is being orchestrated by Ernst Elsen, a destitute Human mason resentful of Dwarf influence on Ubersreik.</p>\n</section>"}

House Bruner draws immense wealth from its deep mines sunk into the southern H&auml;gercrybs, and despite centuries of affluence, the mines there show no signs of playing out. The Bruners bought the neighbouring duchy of Karstadt some decades ago from the troubled House Karstadt, which brought fertile farmlands and the major road into Ubersreik under Bruner control, not to mention a number of profitable tollgates. The Bruners demanded the Karstadts surrendered their patent of nobility as a term of the sale, which was supported by the ruling Jungfreuds at the time, effectively making the Karstadts commoners.

Indeed, many a visitor to Ubersreik has had the misfortune of receiving a guided tour when merely feigning polite interest!</p>\n<p>Two distinct networks exist: one to the city&rsquo;s north, and another to the south. Both networks discharge into the Teufel through wide, steel-grated culverts. The northern sewer-gate is named the Magnusschleuse, and the southern the Sigmarschleuse. Both are checked routinely to ensure no undesirables gain entrance to Ubersreik illicitly (or that those who do have bribed the right people). However, as responsibility for this task lay with the Jungfreuds, neither gate has been officially checked for some time.</p>\n<p>Each network comprises around a dozen major, arterial sewers, through which a four-foot wide effluent channel flows, flanked by equally wide walkways. The ceilings are high to allow for the dispersal of noxious fumes and vapours. Smaller tunnels connect these arterial sewers. These have a lower ceiling and only a single walkway to one side. Vaulted chambers, twenty-feet across, sit at the junctions. Intricate carvings of Dwarf faces line the chambers&rsquo; columns, though few consider the splendid sight worth the appalling reek. Most waste reaches the sewers through narrow lead pipes, though larger houses and estates have wider pipes that are more akin to small tunnels. Sewer grates are also found on the streets of the more affluent areas on the south side, such as the Hill, or the Merchant Quarter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When Greenskins razed the town 200 years ago, the sewers were untouched, and many hid beneath as Orcs and Goblins rampaged above. Later, when Magnus the Pious returned to the Empire and marched to retake Ubersreik, Empire infiltrators, led by Dwarf scouts, entered the town through the sewer grates. Once inside, they crept through the streets and opened the town gates, surprising the occupying Greenskin forces by simultaneously attacking from above and beneath. This story is well known locally, but the invading Altdorfers have no idea just how easily the town walls can be circumvented.</p>\n<p>Despite the best efforts of the town&rsquo;s ratcatchers, sewerjacks and Watch, the sewers remain host to a number of undesirable creatures. The southern network, known as the Sigmarsewers after its sewer-gate the Sigmarschleuse, is better maintained, especially of late, given the rat catchers&rsquo; regular patrols. Nonetheless, there have been numerous sightings of fast-moving Beastmen, with ratlike visages and high-pitched, chittering voices.

This means Viktor von Walfen, archduke of Upper Teufel, should be in control. However, the archduke is little more than a puppet for Karl-Franz, so the Emperor has sent a herald, Emmanuelle Nacht, to represent him in all matters rather than allow the archduke any authority. Not only has this angered the archduke, but it is also rumoured to be an unwanted imposition on Nacht, who had business of her own to attend in Altdorf.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Currently, Lady&rsquo;s Vale is relatively depopulated due to repeated Greenskin raids down through the decades.

The fortified grounds are the third highest on the Hill, though the primary manor it houses is relatively modest, for all it is significantly larger than most Reiklanders could ever dream of owning.</p>\n<p>The main building has two floors containing a score or so rooms, the largest of which is a sizeable hall, extended just twelve years ago to accommodate larger functions as the family line swelled. Beside the manor is a stables and coach house with space for 24 horses and four coaches. Other buildings are spotted across the grounds, which also contain several copses of trees, ornamental ponds, and an impressive maze to amuse visiting guests.</p>\n<p>House Karstadt is known for trading in ores, metal, and luxury goods, running mines, and, more recently, moneylending. It maintains a bank in Ubersreik&rsquo;s Merchant Quarter, and owns a number of well-guarded warehouses on the north bank of the Teufel. The Karstadts also have offices in Altdorf and Nuln, all managed by prominent family members, and finance several merchant trains crossing the Grey Lady Pass to Bretonnia and the Dwarf Holds.</p>\n<p>Unknown to most, the Karstadts were formerly nobles of Ubersreik. Decades ago, Baron Victor Karstadt chose to surrender his nobility as a condition of a deal with the von Bruners to secure a significant loan. Contrary to all commentators at the time, it turned out to be a prudent decision. The family fortunes have significantly changed for the better since the von Bruner deal, as evidenced by their growing numbers and luxurious accomodations.</p>\n<p>@Actor[Hellin Karstadt-Stampf] is the current head of the family and a woman so wealthy the Jungfreuds courted her for years, despite her effective lack of nobility. After teasing Sigismund von Jungfreud for almost three years, she eventually chose to marry a spectacularly wealthy merchant from Altdorf instead, a decision that caused uproar in Ubersreik at the time. For many years it was a matter of some debate whether she married for love, or for riches, though most suggested it was the latter.</p>\n<p>Perhaps proving this opinion true, Hellin&rsquo;s husband, Leuthold, rarely leaves the Karstadt-Stampf offices in Altdorf. His primary interest is in banking, so he spends much of his time consolidating that business in the imperial capital. Consequently, he hasn&rsquo;t been seen in Ubersreik for several years, which is, of course, a juicy piece of gossip for local busybodies, who are quick to conclude the Karstadt-Stampf marriage has broken down. The hearsay concerning this is only exacerbated by Hellin&rsquo;s vociferous, and oftshared, hatred for Altdorf, which means she has never travelled to see her husband. Unsurprisngly, most believe she has no love for her husband beyond his business acumen and deep coffers.</p>\n<p>However, Hellin&rsquo;s love for her many children, strong-willed though they may be, is undeniable. She hosts lavish parties whenever one should return to Ubersreik, and goes out of her way to attend to their every need, no matter how grand. Helping Hellin achieve this, @Actor[Josef Specht], the Karstadt-Stampf purser, is never far from her side. An unassuming fellow, Specht is an almost invisible presence, yet is quickly on hand with a quill and ink, or a supply of coins, should he be needed. Of course, the gossipmongers of Ubersreik presume Sprecht offers far more than simple financial advice to his mistress, for all it is widely known he is a happily married man.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>&bull; hellin&rsquo;s son, Alfred, yearns for a title to complement the wealth he will inherit when his mother passes. he is convinced the von bruners retain his Grandfather&rsquo;s patents of nobility. he will richly reward anyone who will break into the bruner Palace to retrieve them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&bull; hellin&rsquo;s daughter, Annika, has no interest in trade, longing instead to pursue a martial career. she will pay the party to train her in secret, hiring them to complete odd jobs around the estate to cover their furtive martial activities. but when Annika gets injured sparring, they will have to think fast.</p>\n</section>"}

Other times, travelling is the adventure itself. Regardless of when it occurs, this chapter provides tools to tell dramatic tales while on the road.</p>\n<p><strong>Travel Steps:</strong> <br />Determine Number of Travel Stages<br />Check Weather &lt;------------|<br />Decide Travel Endeavours&nbsp; &nbsp;| loop<br />Roll for Travel Encounters -|<br />Arrival, if this was the final stage<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Travel Stages</strong><br />A journey is divided into a number of Travel Stages. The number of Stages is up to GM discretion, with longer journeys having more Stages. The GM should feel free to adjust the number of Stages based on the Players&rsquo; preferences. For some groups, detailed journeys with a plethora of random encounters and challenges can become an exciting, memorable part of their Character&rsquo;s adventure. For other groups, a brief description of the journey with one or two complications to add some spice is more than enough.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once the number of Stages is determined, it is modified by the lowest Movement among the Characters, whether on foot, mounted, or in a vehicle. If this is 3 or less, the journey should be increased by 1&ndash;2 stages. If the Characters are all lucky enough to possess mounts with a Movement of 6 or more, the total number of Stages is halved to a minimum of 1</p>\n<p>Characters may attempt to reduce this number further with a Challenging (+0) Navigation or a Lore Test. The Test must be relevant to the location, such as Lore (Reikland). Having a proper map of the route makes the Test Average (+20). A success reduces the number of Stages by 1, to a minimum of 1.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A journey between neighbouring settlements usually consists of a single Stage. Longer journeys between important cities take between 2 and 4 Stages. Any journey longer than this should be broken up into multiple legs, with stops to rest, resupply, and introduce new adventures to the Characters. If your group enjoys a more involved travel experience, increase the number of Stages by 2 or more.</p>\n<p>For example, B&ouml;genhafen to Middenheim might instead be B&ouml;genhafen to Altdorf, and then Altdorf to Middenheim.</p>\n<p>Ex. <em>Everyone wants to go from Altdorf to Middenheim. Gunnar and Molrella are slower, and they can&rsquo;t wait that long, so they decide to get mounts. Salundra makes a Lore (Reikland) Test and succeeds, so they go even faster. The GM decides that the journey from Altdorf to Middenheim is quite far, and consists of 4 Stages. Thanks to the mounts, no one has a Movement of 3 or less. Salundra&rsquo;s excellent navigation reduces the number of stages by 1, for a total of 3 Stages &mdash; an arduous trek indeed!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Check Weather:<br /></strong>Compare current weather to @JournalEntry[duZW7vxP9vmSlbkS]{Effects of Weather}</p>\n<p><strong>Travel Endeavours</strong><br />As the Characters travel the Empire&rsquo;s roads, they will find themselves with a surprising amount of time on their hands. Whether in the back of a coach, around a campfire, or waiting for their dawdling, short-legged companions, each Character has one Endeavour per Stage of their journey.</p>\n<p>Travel Endeavours represent continued action over an entire Stage of a journey, meaning that even if they are performed correctly, they are still tiring. If a Character fails a Test during an Endeavour they receive a Fatigued Condition.</p>\n<p>Whilst most of these Endeavours can be attempted by anyone, some are better suited to a particular Class or Career. Additionally, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion, Endeavours found in Chapter 6: Between Adventures in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay may be performed during a journey. It is up to the Characters to decide in what order they perform their Travel Endeavours.</p>\n<p><strong>Travel Encounters</strong></p>\n<p>Travel in the Old World can be many things, but rarely is it predictable. Paranoid road wardens, intrepid merchants, and dutiful pilgrims throng the highways of the Empire, whilst less beaten tracks are home to roving bands of mutants, unsanctioned toll roads, and watchful bandits. The Characters may experience such events more or less at random, but all Encounters should add either to the flavour of the world, or to the themes and narrative of the current story. The @RollTable[ltkdNGlrLQXCehrq]{Travel Table} may also be used.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Positive Encounters are generally beneficial to your party, though many groups find a way to turn any situation against them! Positive Encounters may be triggered by an Impressive success or better on a Travel Endeavour, or simply if you wish to reward the Characters for being particularly clever or well prepared. @RollTable[2K4z850W3jp4IsPL]{Positive Encounters}</li>\n<li>Coincidental Encounters are neither harmful nor beneficial to the Character, they are simply the sort of thing travellers in the Old World run into as a matter of course.

Be sure to describe in reasonable detail what the party sees as they arrive &mdash; are there towering gates, barred shut, or wide open fields of wheat with cottages nestled neatly between? How are the locals &mdash; warm and welcoming, or gruff and suspicious? Such details will help Characters get a feel for the location, and will help set their expectations.</p>\n<p>Consider the Characters&rsquo; actions and the Encounters they experienced &mdash; did word travel ahead of them of their deeds, or misdeeds, on the road?</p>\n<p>Characters who arrive at their destination suffering from a Fatigued Condition are likely in a sorry state, and need to clean themselves up or suffer a penalty to Fellowship Tests due to their scruffy appearance. This penalty is dependent on the Character&rsquo;s Status. Gold Status Characters suffer a &minus;20 penalty to Fellowship Tests and Silver a &minus;10. Brass Status Characters suffer no penalty at all &mdash; scruffiness is expected of them.</p>\n<p>As the length of a Stage is somewhat abstracted, any diseases contracted on the road that have an incubation period, such as the Common Cold or Packer&rsquo;s Pox, become full-blown outbreaks during the Arrival phase.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Characters are likely to arrive at their destination in need of supplies and services. Performing an Average (+20) Lore (region) Test reveals the best place to find these, or the Characters may ask around and hope for the best. A successful Challenging (+0) Gossip Test lets a Character know a little about current affairs, and this may be a good time to drop in some of the rumours outlined in Enemy in Shadows (pages 15 and 57).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just as the Characters form an opinion of their destination, news of the Characters&rsquo; arrival often leads to local rumours and gossip. Depending on how they arrived &mdash; in a fine carriage, after a disagreement at the city gate, or unannounced in the dead of night &mdash; they may find that many have already made up their minds about their nature and intent.</p>\n<p>Reaching their destination should be a satisfying moment for the Characters, having put the dangers of the road behind them for a time, but it is also a good moment to subvert their expectations. Perhaps their destination, reputedly safe, has fallen under the sway of a local criminal or an enemy of the Characters. Perhaps they catch a glimpse of someone watching them, almost as if expecting their arrival. Alternatively, if you&rsquo;re feeling generous, a friend made upon the road is awaiting them, a cozy table by the fire reserved in a nearby inn.</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, the Characters are now ready to resume their adventures &mdash; or, after a short rest, set out on the next leg of their journey.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

Truly, my discussions with the Supreme Patriarch have been profound.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Patriarch said these words, one night over dinner, and I memorised them to put pen to paper upon returning to my cell. I can claim no ownership over this wisdom, but count myself lucky to share in it now.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;<em>Often I find neophytes to the Colleges of Magic are seduced by the nature of qhaysh &mdash; the 'High Magic' of the Elves &mdash; for they believe that a combination of the eight Winds of Magic must surely be more powerful than mastery of a 'mere' one. To such students I assign a week of orchestral music, at some of the finest establishments throughout Altdorf. Many of my fellow professors have called me mad for such 'luxurious punishment', but I am indeed clear-sighted.</em></p>\n<p><em>I explain to my students that each Wind of Magic is an instrument in an orchestra. Chamon, the lilting, twanging sounds of the bandora. Aqshy, the intrusive, yet elegant Rauschpfeife. Hysh, the indomitable, regal, organ. Even ghur, the primitive, primal, and necessary tabor! Individually, these instruments are beautiful in their own ways, moving, impactful, potent, powerful. One cannot be said to be objectively paramount over another.</em></p>\n<p><em>And yet, when the orchestra plays together, it has the potential to stun a crowd, to sway an audience, to move a nation. The orchestra is a symphony of mastery, a melody of instruments working in harmony. But, in the orchestra, a lack of skill on any one part can sully the performance of the others; the most moving viol can be tarnished by an ill-played curtal. However, a master of the lute, playing in solitary, pulling their chords, may yet affect an audience to an astounding degree, though the level of mastery must be far greater.</em></p>\n<p><em>Just so are the Winds of Magic. The High Mage may weave together many Winds in harmony, and affect greater change, but at far greater risk, and reliant on far greater strictures. But the Hierophant, once they know their craft, can be free from the cares of the other Winds, and focus on perfection in hysh.</em></p>\n<p><em>All this is to describe magick without expressing the true dangers &mdash; the lure of qhaysh for the Human, is potentially the road to dhar. Dhar &mdash; Dark Magic &mdash; is to play every instrument at once, in an utter cacophony of discordance. Indeed, this 'performance' will be loud. It will be impactful. It will be nigh unforgettable! But it will be hollow, pointless, senseless, and abhorrent. It is power without art. It is noise without reason. It is the antithesis of the Empire.</em></p>\n<p><em>After such a lecture, I find most students nodding as if they&rsquo;ve received some simple wisdom, that their pursuit of their lone Wind is indeed the way it should be. Those few who shake their heads, are the ones I pay attention to: they&rsquo;ve heard the secret lie to my words, and are determined to become the orchestra, to draw nine hands across eight strings, and to break the shackles that Teclis laid upon us. Those few are my true pupils, and the rest are the antithesis of life itself</em>.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>- Cantor Carolus Entschlafen</p>","img":""}

People,</div>\n<div>especially rootless adventurers with no local ties, must be very careful when dealing with the law. Even if they are innocent, failing to show proper respect to law officers, or doing anything that law officers might find even mildly irritating, is a sure way to get arrested.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Characters who are actually guilty need to tread even more cautiously, as might expect.

More serious crimes such as theft, breaking and entering, and so on, often (not always) end in a trial before the nearest magistrate. If a Character resists arrest, the law enforcers are quite likely to feel entitled to dispense justice on the spot, which usually ends with burial in an unmarked grave.

Unless there is incontrovertible evidence against a noble or wealthy merchant, these people rarely come to trial, as a few well-placed Crowns are sufficient to have proceedings dropped. The very poor tend not to reach court either: they languish in prison for years or end up in a penal colony breaking up rocks to repair the roads. Occasionally one of the poor will be placed on trial to take the rap for a guilty noble who has bribed away their transgressions. Additionally, the nobility may only be judged by their direct liege lords, whoever they may be, subject to the specific laws of their respective province.

When combining multiple difficulties, use the following guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the situation would apply two or more penalties, simply add the modifiers together to a maximum of &ndash;30 or Very Hard. For example, fog and aiming for a specific body part both make Weapon Skill Tests Hard (&ndash;20).

Confident, silent hunters, they roam everywhere, from the echoing halls of the great and good down to the dirtiest, lowliest hovel. There they catch mice, spiders, rats, and other small creatures. Many are so independent that they don't even require much in the way of feeding. Because they are so common, Cats are some of the cheapest animals to buy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/610164117277245482/690417144864964628/unknown.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"755\" height=\"163\" /><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/610164117277245482/690417384716238898/unknown.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"191\" height=\"426\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Hochland Forest Cat<br /></strong>The Hochland Forest Cat is a native of the Middle Mountains. It is adapted to extremely cold conditions, and has a glossy top coat and wooly undercoat, which somewhat hide the breed's long legs and powerful body. Known for being swift and effective hunters, as well as being intelligent, friendly, and very good with children, the Forest Cat is one of the most popular house cats of the middle Empire.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/610164117277245482/690418612183498772/unknown.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"714\" height=\"158\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Longhaired Drake<br /></strong>The Longhaired Drake is the largest breed of domesticated cat outside the occasional, and very rare, big cat. Larger than most dogs, the breed is usually found wild in western Drakwald Forest where it hunts game of all sizes. A common sight in the coaching inns and fortified hostels of Middenland, the Drake is renowned for its ratting skills, and is even used by some Rat Catchers of Middenheim and Delberz in preference to dogs. Sporting a thick, silky coat, always striped ginger and liver-red, the breed is famous for its bushy tail, sour disposition, and its startlingly golden eyes that appear quite lizard-like. Local myths, most spanning back to the lost Grand Province of Drakwald, claim the Drake has a close association with Dragons, but such tales seem fanciful at best.<strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/610164117277245482/690418645628878888/unknown.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"745\" height=\"170\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Nordland Wildcat<br /></strong>Slightly larger and significantly more robust than standard domesticated cats, the Nordland Wildcat is a common sight in the forests of the Northern Empire, and was first tamed over two thousand years ago. Frequently used as housecats in Nordland, the breed is known for its bad temper, dark stripes, and bushy tail. According to the folklore of the north, the breed is famous for keeping ghosts at bay. Because of this, they are a common pet for northern Morrians, and, should hauntings be rumoured, commonfolk often seek out Wildcats to protect themselves.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/610164117277245482/690418708841103376/unknown.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"763\" height=\"171\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Verger Tuftcat<br /></strong>The large Verger Tuftcat is only found in the Northern Marches of Ostland and the Eastern Oblast of Kislev. It has a dense silvery-white coat with a ruffed face and tufted ears. It is distinctive for having longer back legs giving it a particularly powerful leap, and for having a stubby, almost non-existent tail. A common pet of Ungol tribesfolk in the area, the Tuftcat is commonly used by hunters to track and fetch small game and fish. Unlike most cats, this breed is not only easy to train, it is surprisingly affectionate.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/610164117277245482/690418740709294151/unknown.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"753\" height=\"176\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Wissenland Lynx<br /></strong>The Wissenland Lynx is one of the larger cat species and is most commonly found roaming the undulating plains of Wissenland and Averland. Rarely domesticated and surprisingly territorial, the animal is favoured for its hunting abilities and its superior ratting skills, but it is notoriously difficult to train. Almost twice the size of a standard cat, the Wissenland was a tawny coat with black spotting and distinctive tufted ears and a ruff, and is sometimes found as a ratting guard-pet.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/610164117277245482/690418779670446090/unknown.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"752\" height=\"177\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>: http://lawhammer.blogspot.com/2020/03/cats-in-cradle.html</p>"}

These large animals are agile, strong, and bred for speed and resolve. They are normally only used for hard warfare, racing, or hunting, with other, more comfortable horses, such as palfreys or cheaper rounceys, used for general riding. Coursers are normally around 16-hands tall and are some of the most majestic horses of the Old World.</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[IR75ZtMXRBWq5ywV]{Destriers}: Destriers, sometimes called 'great horses', are the largest and strongest of the three 'chargers', or war horses. They are highly prized by the Empire's Knightly Orders and command enormous prices at market. These towering animals are most commonly seen jousting or on the battlefield. Few use these horses for everyday riding; instead, most ride comfortable palfreys or inexpensive rounceys, afraid to damage their prized stock for no reason. Destriers are usually around 17 hands tall, although some rare breeds far exceed this.</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[i7d6fdAghfdz62q4]{Donkeys}:&nbsp; Donkeys (also called asses) are smaller members of the horse family known for their strength, sure-footedness, and endurance. Relatively cheap to buy and maintain, Donkeys are a common sight in all civilised lands, where they are used principally as draught or pack animals. Adapted to survive in hot environments, Donkeys are more common in the south of the Old World than the north. They come in many different sizes, some larger than most horses, but 10-11 hands is an average height.</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[CGbWtICPxoQBp6iJ]{Dray}: Drays, or draught horses, are bred to haul great weights, and are thus some of the largest and strongest horses in the Old World. Most commonly seen working fields, drawing carts, hauling logs, or pulling field artillery to battlefields, these enormous creatures are known for the feathering on their lower legs and their calm natures. Most Drays are around 17 Hands tall.</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[g1Bpq1E9UF9Xbpfc]{Mules}: A crossbreed between horses and donkeys, and invariably sterile, mules usually take the best qualities of each. They are cheaper to keep than a horse, less picky about food and stabling, and stronger for their size. On the other hand, they are larger, more agile, and faster than donkeys, and generally friendlier. Known for their endurance and their sure-footedness, mules are usually used as draught or pack animals. They can range significantly in size, but normally lie somewhere between 11-14 hands tall.</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[hcz0V7tB4DBU401x]{Palfreys}:&nbsp; Palfreys are light-weight steeds with a very smooth gait, making them particularly suitable for long-distance riding. Most Palfreys are expensive because of the superior comfort they offer, meaning they are ridden almost exclusively by nobles, richer merchants, and important clerics. Palfreys are usually around 15 hands tall, but sizes can vary considerably.</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[oYx2CijA2FnT4Oor]{Ponies}:&nbsp; Ponies are smaller horses &ndash; those 14 hands or shorter &ndash; their breeds often originating from areas with harsher habitats, such as Kislev or World's Edge Mountains. They are strong for their size and notoriously mischievous, usually deployed for driving, riding, or as pack animals. They are also used to teach youths how to ride horses, or offered at travelling carnivals for children's pony rides. They come in a variety of sizes, but most are around 13 hands at the withers.</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[hKMiddHRHjqb6i7g]{Rouncies}:&nbsp; Rounceys are all-purpose horses, suitable for riding, draught work, carrying loads, and more. They are also trainable for war, making them the smallest of the three 'chargers', or war horses. Because of their relatively smooth gaits, Rounceys are the preferred mount for most ranged cavalry such as horse archers or pistolliers. Given their all-round utility and relative cheapness, Rounceys are the most commonly encountered horses in the Old World, and are usually 14&ndash;15 hands tall.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Source: http://lawhammer.blogspot.com/2020/03/my-kingdom-for-horse.html</p>"}

Here&rsquo;s how to run a pursuit:</p>\n<p>1: <strong>Determine Distance</strong> &mdash; The GM decides how far ahead the pursued are from the pursuers, and assigns a number to represent the size of the head start, called the Distance. Typically, this will range from 1 for those almost in reach, to 4 for those with a good lead, to 8 for those almost beyond reach when the pursuit begins.</p>\n<p>2: <strong>Test</strong> &mdash; Everyone actively moving in the pursuit rolls a Test for their movement &mdash; typically this will be a Drive, Ride, or Athletics Test depending upon the circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3: <strong>Update Distance</strong> &mdash; The lowest SL of the pursued and the highest SL of the pursuers is compared, the difference between these is added to the Distance if the pursued won, and subtracted from the Distance number if the pursuers won.</p>\n<p>4: <strong>Determine Outcome</strong> &mdash; If the Distance falls to 0 or less, the pursuers have caught their quarry! The pursued can then sacrifice their slowest member that Round to delay the pursuers as the rest continue to flee, or they can stop and confront their pursuers. If the slowest of the pursued is abandoned, the pursuers decide who stops to confront the unfortunate and who continues in pursuit. If the poor abandoned runner is not a priority target it&rsquo;s quite likely the pursuers will continue their pursuit of their target. If Distance reaches 10+, the pursuers have lost their quarry and the pursuit is over&hellip; for now! If the Distance is still 1&ndash;9, the pursuit continues, return to step 2. As each Round passes, it&rsquo;s important to describe what just happened in a fun and exciting fashion. If you score a large SL, describe people getting out of the way, giving you an opportunity to make ground. If you score a negative SL, describe tripping over crates, running into people, or slamming your coach against a wall, slowing you down.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Movement Modifiers</strong></p>\n<p>If some of the characters in the pursuit have a higher Movement, they gain a bonus SL equal to the difference in Movement. So, if you had Move 5 and you were chasing a Move 4 character, you would gain +1 SL on your pursuit roll.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Chase Complication</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dodge that</strong>!: each round, the character who rolled the highest sl can create an obstacle. an obstacle could be pulling a pile of barrels into the path of a pursuer, or perhaps calling out for help to catch someone running away. the winner chooses one character: that character suffers a penalty of &ndash;1 sl next round as they have to deal with the obstacle. make sure to take time to describe exactly what has happened to keep the chase entertaining.</p>\n<p><strong>Consider the environment</strong>: perhaps there is a bridge coming up? or a gap to jump? or a fence to leap over? or a city gate to pass through? the Gm can throw in different tests as the rounds progress, mixing up the requirement each round. so, round 1 may need an athletics test as everyone runs, round 2 may require a leadership or Intimidate test to pass through a guarded gate, round 3 may need another athletics test to jump a small stream, and round 4 may be sprint across an open field (modified by Movement again).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

A few days of bad weather can turn a firm, smooth highway into an almost impassable morass. While some effort is made to keep the Empire&rsquo;s great highways open, the smaller roads - some little better than dirt tracks at the best of times - are often merely a collection of puddles and mud.</p>\n<p>The busiest overland routes are the roads from Altdorf to Middenheim, the Old Forest Road leading from Wurtbad to Middenheim, and the routes over the Grey Mountains into Bretonnia. Beyond these, countless miles of lesser roads link cities, towns, and villages together, running through the deep forests and across hills and plains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The Highways</strong></p>\n<p>The state of the Empire&rsquo;s highway system owes much to Emperor Wilhelm the Wise. Having heard of the extraordinary delivery speeds offered by the Ostland Checkpoint Service used along the Kislev Verge and into the Northern Marches, Wilhelm decided to duplicate the system across the Empire. In a decree of 2453, a system of Imperial messengers was created to carry news rapidly between all of the Empire&rsquo;s great cities, especially in times of war, to complement the Imperial Post. By commandeering fresh horses from coaching inns along the way, a messenger could travel from Kislev&rsquo;s borders to Altdorf&nbsp; in 6 days, and from the notorious Black Fire Pass in just 11 days.</p>\n<p>The 2453 decree demanded the Prime Estates set aside cavalry from the State Regiments they were obliged to raise. Naturally, the nobility of the Empire immediately looked for exemptions, and many simply ignored the &lsquo;demand&rsquo;. However, as the scheme was sensible and costs were low, many nobles provided patrols for their local area.</p>\n<p>The decree also laid down standards for the size and quality of the Empire&rsquo;s arterial highways. The rulers of each province were made responsible for the maintenance of all important highways that passed through their lands.</p>\n<p>According to Wilhelm&rsquo;s decree, an Imperial Highway must be 20 ft wide (enough to permit two wagons to pass comfortably) and constructed of hard, crushed stone tamped down to provide a firm surface. It must also be constructed with a camber, allowing rain to wash away to either side. The roads that run alongside the great rivers, such as the Talabheim to Altdorf road, are designated Imperial highways, but because the river takes the bulk of heavy traffic, they tend not to be maintained to a high standard. Often, the road is of &lsquo;highway quality&rsquo; for a few miles beyond the city but becomes a major road after that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Major Roads</strong><br />Major roads are maintained by the communities they serve, often funded by tolls or taxes on goods passing particular spots. Those closest to a town or city are the best maintained, 8&ndash;12 ft wide with occasional wider spots where traffic in opposite directions can pass. Further from the nearest town, their chipped-stone or gravel surfaces turn to dirt and they become narrower, with the vegetation to either side growing inward.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Roads</strong><br />Minor roads are often little more than dirt tracks, only kept free of vegetation by the passing of wheels, feet, and hooves. They follow the &lsquo;path of least resistance&rsquo;, wandering around hills and other obstacles. Often these were little more than game trails or footpaths before being given the grand title of &lsquo;road&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

It dominates Ubersreik, covering almost an eighth of the town. It is ringed by huge parapets connecting directly to the town&rsquo;s walls, making it integral to Ubersreik&rsquo;s defence.&nbsp; A secure tunnel leads from Black Rock to the Magnus Tower, allowing for troops and messages to pass from fortress to fortress, should the town fall. For centuries it was the bastion of the Jungfreuds.</p>\n<p>The invading troops from Altdorf made Black Rock their home, tearing down the silver and blue banners of the von Jungfreuds and replacing them with Altdorf&rsquo;s red and blue, a gesture of disrespect many locals find galling.</p>\n<p>Within Black Rock&rsquo;s walls lies a bustling community. In many ways, it is a town within a town. The primary keep, Black Rock Castle, is the largest single structure within the complex.

As many of these workers &mdash; including servants, gardeners, artisans, and more &mdash; were local, this has led to much resentment among the working classes of Ubersreik, not that most would voice their discontent to the foreign soldiers patrolling their town. Most of the workers&rsquo; homes are now taken as billets by troops from Altdorf. Indeed, all five regiments led by General von Dabernick to seize Ubersreik are barracked in Black Rock. Two of these are normally found patrolling the surrounding duchy at any one time, meaning there are rarely more than a thousand Altdorf soldiers in Black Rock at any one time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

As noted in Money to Burn, all coin remaining at the end of your &lsquo;Between Adventures&rsquo; phase is lost before the next adventure begins unless it is saved with this Endeavour. So, if you have a lot of money spare it may be worth a trip to the bank. If you are using a Banking Endeavour to retain your money, you must first decide whether to save your money by investing it with a reputable banking institution, or to stash it somewhere less secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Investing</strong>: You must be of the Gold and Silver social tiers to save with a banking house. Your money will be reasonably safe and it should accrue interest. When undertaking a Banking Endeavour to deposit money in a bank, determine the interest rate of your account, by choosing a number between 1 and 10 (alternatively you may simply roll 1d10). This is the rate of interest you will accrue, and also how risky the investment is. Withdrawing funds requires another Banking Endeavour. This may take place immediately after the initial Endeavour, or after subsequent adventures have occurred. Roll 1d100: if you roll equal to or less than your rate of interest, the venture has gone bankrupt and you have lost all of your money. If you roll over the interest rate, you receive your initial funds, plus the interest accrued.</p>\n<p><strong>Stashing</strong>: All characters may choose to stash their loot. This is a risky strategy, involving hiding it on your person, in your mattress, or burying it somewhere. Stashed money never accrues any interest. Players may withdraw money from a stash before the start of an adventure, without undertaking an Endeavour. Roll 1d100: if you roll 10 or lower, your stash has been found and you have lost all your money, otherwise you recieve your initial funds. If you successfully withdraw your funds they will be available for you when you start your next adventure, in addition to any funds secured via an Income Endeavour.</p>\n<p><strong> Example</strong>: <em>Gerhard and Ulli&rsquo;s courage in the face of a Greenskin horde (not to mention some judicious looting) has earned them a haul worth 10 gold crowns each.

Gerhard will earn 6% interest on his deposit (12 silver shillings, see page 288), and the bank will fail if he rolls 6 or less on d100 when he tries to make a withdrawal. Ulli &mdash; a gambler at heart &mdash; buries his money near a mile-marker on the road to Ubersreik. He doesn&rsquo;t need to make an Endeavour to get access to his loot, but tragically he rolls 07 when he tries to recover it, and finds nothing but freshly disturbed earth, an empty chest, and whole heap of regret.&nbsp;</em></p>"}

It&rsquo;s impossible to light a torch, and lighting a lantern requires a successful Outdoor Survival or Dexterity Test, as the Characters&rsquo; tinder is very damp. Above the soft hiss of the rain can be heard the noises of the forest&rsquo;s nocturnal denizens going about their business.
