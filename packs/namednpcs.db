You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess.

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and oﬀers 30.

If the crowd is unruly, or not receptive to your words, the test is opposed by the crowd’s average Willpower (typically 35). A failure shows the crowd is unconvinced. the public speaking and master orator talents can significantly increase the number of people you affect with public speaking. an astounding Failure (-6) (see page 152) in a charm test means your crowd quickly becomes an angry mob, with you as the target of their ire…&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Begging</h3>\n<p>The Charm skill can be used to beg on the streets. A successful test will scrounge Fellowship Bonus × SL brass pennies per hour from passers-by, with the Difficulty modified by the pitch chosen for begging, and how much sympathy your appearance can elicit. If you score no SL, but still pass the skill test, you only manage to scrounge a single pfennig. an astounding Failure (-6) means you may have attracted problems from the local Watchmen, found some trouble with&nbsp; other, local beggars, or suffer some other significant set-back.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Characters who are caught begging by their peers or associates will likely lose status unless they are already in the Beggar, or in some other destitute, career.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total"}}},{"_id":"iJnRuiFHlD16SDuC","flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"name":"Charm Animal","type":"skill","img":"systems/wfrp4e/icons/skills/skill.png","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Your aptitude for be friending, quickly calming, or subjugating animals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Passing a Charm Animal Test allows you to inﬂuence the behavior of one or more animals, to a maximum of Willpower Bonus + SL.

If the crowd is unruly, or not receptive to your words, the test is opposed by the crowd’s average Willpower (typically 35). A failure shows the crowd is unconvinced. the public speaking and master orator talents can significantly increase the number of people you affect with public speaking. an astounding Failure (-6) (see page 152) in a charm test means your crowd quickly becomes an angry mob, with you as the target of their ire…&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Begging</h3>\n<p>The Charm skill can be used to beg on the streets.

If you score no SL, but still pass the skill test, you only manage to scrounge a single pfennig. an astounding Failure (-6) means you may have attracted problems from the local Watchmen, found some trouble with&nbsp; other, local beggars, or suffer some other significant set-back.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Characters who are caught begging by their peers or associates will likely lose status unless they are already in the Beggar, or in some other destitute, career.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":7},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total"}}},{"_id":"FPDmZfZrESN27HmL","flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"name":"Charm Animal","type":"skill","img":"systems/wfrp4e/icons/skills/skill.png","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Your aptitude for be friending, quickly calming, or subjugating animals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Passing a Charm Animal Test allows you to inﬂuence the behavior of one or more animals, to a maximum of Willpower Bonus + SL.

The precise manner of initiating an Intimidate Test depends on context: while it is generally accompanied by an overt threat, sometimes a subtle implication or even a look is enough. Intimidate is almost always Opposed by your target’s Cool Skill; if successful, you can intimidate a number of targets up to your Strength Bonus + SL. Each will react to Intimidate based on their individual personalities and how successful you were in menacing them, but in all cases, they will back down or move out of the way and will not speak out against you, or they will alternatively accept combat is the only way forward and prepare their weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you cause <a href=\"onenote:Rules.one#Psychology&amp;section-id={72A7ED0B-2CD7-4D8D-A645-D070C59EBB41}&amp;page-id={330E177D-7F43-48A3-AD0B-6F334311BC56}&amp;object-id={6D08B41D-0423-4EDC-9653-914E3682A9AB}&amp;28&amp;base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/13dd1eed17b2d56d/D%5e0D/Documents/Warhammer%20Fantasy%20Roleplay/Rules\">Fear</a> in all Intimidated targets.

Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in aﬀected opponents.

Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and oﬀers 30.

His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and oﬀers 30.

His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and oﬀers 30.
