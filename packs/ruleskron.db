Here&rsquo;s how to run a pursuit:</p>\n<p>1: <strong>Determine Distance</strong> &mdash; The GM decides how far ahead the pursued are from the pursuers, and assigns a number to represent the size of the head start, called the Distance. Typically, this will range from 1 for those almost in reach, to 4 for those with a good lead, to 8 for those almost beyond reach when the pursuit begins.</p>\n<p>2: <strong>Test</strong> &mdash; Everyone actively moving in the pursuit rolls a Test for their movement &mdash; typically this will be a Drive, Ride, or Athletics Test depending upon the circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3: <strong>Update Distance</strong> &mdash; The lowest SL of the pursued and the highest SL of the pursuers is compared, the difference between these is added to the Distance if the pursued won, and subtracted from the Distance number if the pursuers won.</p>\n<p>4: <strong>Determine Outcome</strong> &mdash; If the Distance falls to 0 or less, the pursuers have caught their quarry! The pursued can then sacrifice their slowest member that Round to delay the pursuers as the rest continue to flee, or they can stop and confront their pursuers. If the slowest of the pursued is abandoned, the pursuers decide who stops to confront the unfortunate and who continues in pursuit. If the poor abandoned runner is not a priority target it&rsquo;s quite likely the pursuers will continue their pursuit of their target. If Distance reaches 10+, the pursuers have lost their quarry and the pursuit is over&hellip; for now! If the Distance is still 1&ndash;9, the pursuit continues, return to step 2. As each Round passes, it&rsquo;s important to describe what just happened in a fun and exciting fashion. If you score a large SL, describe people getting out of the way, giving you an opportunity to make ground. If you score a negative SL, describe tripping over crates, running into people, or slamming your coach against a wall, slowing you down.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Movement Modifiers</strong></p>\n<p>If some of the characters in the pursuit have a higher Movement, they gain a bonus SL equal to the difference in Movement. So, if you had Move 5 and you were chasing a Move 4 character, you would gain +1 SL on your pursuit roll.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Chase Complication</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dodge that</strong>!: each round, the character who rolled the highest sl can create an obstacle. an obstacle could be pulling a pile of barrels into the path of a pursuer, or perhaps calling out for help to catch someone running away. the winner chooses one character: that character suffers a penalty of &ndash;1 sl next round as they have to deal with the obstacle. make sure to take time to describe exactly what has happened to keep the chase entertaining.</p>\n<p><strong>Consider the environment</strong>: perhaps there is a bridge coming up? or a gap to jump? or a fence to leap over? or a city gate to pass through? the Gm can throw in different tests as the rounds progress, mixing up the requirement each round. so, round 1 may need an athletics test as everyone runs, round 2 may require a leadership or Intimidate test to pass through a guarded gate, round 3 may need another athletics test to jump a small stream, and round 4 may be sprint across an open field (modified by Movement again).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

As noted in Money to Burn, all coin remaining at the end of your &lsquo;Between Adventures&rsquo; phase is lost before the next adventure begins unless it is saved with this Endeavour. So, if you have a lot of money spare it may be worth a trip to the bank. If you are using a Banking Endeavour to retain your money, you must first decide whether to save your money by investing it with a reputable banking institution, or to stash it somewhere less secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Investing</strong>: You must be of the Gold and Silver social tiers to save with a banking house. Your money will be reasonably safe and it should accrue interest. When undertaking a Banking Endeavour to deposit money in a bank, determine the interest rate of your account, by choosing a number between 1 and 10 (alternatively you may simply roll 1d10). This is the rate of interest you will accrue, and also how risky the investment is. Withdrawing funds requires another Banking Endeavour. This may take place immediately after the initial Endeavour, or after subsequent adventures have occurred. Roll 1d100: if you roll equal to or less than your rate of interest, the venture has gone bankrupt and you have lost all of your money. If you roll over the interest rate, you receive your initial funds, plus the interest accrued.</p>\n<p><strong>Stashing</strong>: All characters may choose to stash their loot. This is a risky strategy, involving hiding it on your person, in your mattress, or burying it somewhere. Stashed money never accrues any interest. Players may withdraw money from a stash before the start of an adventure, without undertaking an Endeavour. Roll 1d100: if you roll 10 or lower, your stash has been found and you have lost all your money, otherwise you recieve your initial funds. If you successfully withdraw your funds they will be available for you when you start your next adventure, in addition to any funds secured via an Income Endeavour.</p>\n<p><strong> Example</strong>: <em>Gerhard and Ulli&rsquo;s courage in the face of a Greenskin horde (not to mention some judicious looting) has earned them a haul worth 10 gold crowns each.

Gerhard will earn 6% interest on his deposit (12 silver shillings, see page 288), and the bank will fail if he rolls 6 or less on d100 when he tries to make a withdrawal. Ulli &mdash; a gambler at heart &mdash; buries his money near a mile-marker on the road to Ubersreik.

The routes between major cities are relatively safe and well-maintained. However, far-flung routes can be little more than muddy tracks. Regardless of the quality, all roads need to be maintained, so most are tolled.</p>\n<p>There is an extensive network of coach routes throughout the province. The busiest routes have coaches running several times per day. The many Coaching Houses of the Reikland are in fierce competition, so the prices are often reasonable and reliability is good. The Four Seasons is the biggest coach company, and is represented along all the major routes.</p>\n<p>Roadside inns are often placed at the convenience of the Coaching Houses. Therefore, journeying by foot, especially away from the major routes, runs the risk of not reaching a safe place to rest before nightfall.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>By River</strong><br />River journeys are often straightforward and perhaps even relaxing. However, this relies on finding a boat going to and from convenient locations. Dedicated passenger barges only travel between the major towns and cities, but can be bribed or persuaded to drop people off along the way. Getting to more obscure locations usually requires hitching a ride with a cargo boat, which can be difficult for large parties.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Pricing</strong><br />The prices listed in Travel Costs do not include meals, lodging, or fodder, although coaches and passenger boats usually charge for the whole package for longer journeys. Package prices can be worked out by combining travel with food and boarding prices. On some ferries, lodging is not required, as passengers sleep on the vessel, either on deck or in a private cabin.</p>\n<p>Cargo barge travel-costs should be individually haggled with barge masters. Often, such passage can be secured for a greatly reduced price, or even for free, if the passenger is willing to work and they know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>\n<p>High class travel is available and de rigueur among the nobility, and can cost many times the listed price, typically ten times or more.

When combining multiple difficulties, use the following guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the situation would apply two or more penalties, simply add the modifiers together to a maximum of &ndash;30 or Very Hard. For example, fog and aiming for a specific body part both make Weapon Skill Tests Hard (&ndash;20).

Similarly, if the situation would apply two or more bonuses, add the modifiers together to a maximum of +60 or Very Easy.</li>\n<li>If the situation would apply a penalty and a bonus, add them together to find the new difficulty. Attacking an opponent while standing in deep snow normally requires a Very Hard (&ndash;30) Test. But attacking an opponent who is Prone requires an Easy (+20) Test.

If you are in close combat, you also suffer a penalty of &ndash;10 to your Melee Test if you target the rider and are smaller than the mount (see Size on page 162).&nbsp;</li>\n<li>A Mount without the&nbsp;Skittish Trait (see page 342) is effectively another combatant, and may use its own Action to attack Engaged targets.</li>\n<li>When Charging, you may use the Strength and Size rules of your mount for the purposes of calculating Damage.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>When riding, you suffer a penalty of &ndash;20 to any attempts to use the Dodge Skill unless you have the Trick Riding Talent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Most mounts are bigger than Characters, meaning they may cause Fear or Terror, and gain other combat advantages as explained on page 341.</p>"}
